                Chandrayaan-3's Vikram Lander and Pragyan Rover on Wedenesday made a successful soft touchdown on the lunar South Pole. With this, India has become the fourth country to successfully conduct a soft landing on the Moon.<br><br>“It is amazing to have the success that Chandrayaan-3 had given the relatively little amount of resources that India has used, it is just a triumph of Indian innovation, human capital and the capabilities that will take India even further,” Gold was quoted as saying by ANI. Mike Gold is currently the Chief Growth Officer of Redwire Space, an American aerospace manufacturer and space infrastructure company.<br><br>“This (Chandrayaan-3) mission will gather invaluable data to help drive our understanding of the Moon, our ability to utilise resources and ultimately where we’re going to establish settlements on the Moon. Whether the mission succeeds in landing or not, the mission itself, in my opinion, is an overall success,” he further noted.
